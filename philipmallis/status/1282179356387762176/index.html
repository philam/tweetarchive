  	      I don't think this is a good idea. We've spent the good part of the past decade trying to get consistent PTV branding of orange = bus, green = tram, blue = train, purple = regional train/coach and we've only recently accomplished this. <br>But now we're throwing that away...

  	      I don't have an issue with identifying line groups by colour in certain situations (e.g PIDs, maps) but needs more thought &amp; transperancy in its rollout - especially how it interacts with other modes and from the perspective of overall network passenger XP &amp; wayfinding (3/3)
